      "Task description: Participants get several pages of description about a dilemma facing a racecar team, which involves deciding whether to go ahead with the race that would begin in the immediate future. The description mentions that the team has been experiencing a series of engine failures and that an engine failure during this race on national television will present a danger to the driver and team's sponsorship. However, if the team does well on the race, it will get a lucrative sponsorship deal.\n",
      "Participants are given a chart with information about the temperatures during the last 7 engine failures, which shows a range of temperatures 53-75 degrees and a mean temperature of 64 degrees. The chart is misleading because it does not contain information about the air temperature when the car does NOT experience an engine failure (therefore, the information is biased).\n",
      "Participants are also given instructions that mention that they can ask for any additional information during the task, but that the request must be precise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Goal: The goal is to come up with reasons and ultimately decide to terminate the participation in the race within a fixed amount of time.\n",
      "The data in the description is gathered from the Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident in 1986. The relationship between ambient temperature and O-ring failure is disguised as the relationship between air temperature and car engine failures. In other words, participants that decide to go ahead with the race make a decision that is parallel to the decision to go ahead with the Space Shuttle Challenger launch.\n",
      "Participants have to recognize that the data they have is inconclusive and ask the experimenter for the air temperatures when the engine has not failed. If they do so, the experimenter provides them with an additional chart of the last 17 races without an engine failure. The chart shows that races are clearly warmer when engine failures do not occur with the range of 66-82 degrees and a mean temperature of 73 degrees.\n",
      "Therefore, the only correct and precise solution to the task is not to proceed with the race, while participants that come up with a conclusion to proceed with the race fail the task. Participants also have to explain their reasoning behind this decision by finding a relationship between engine failures and air temperatures.\n",

      "Task description: Participants are given a shared grid, in which some squares in the grid are colored in, and other squares in the grid are not colored in. The grid is interactive, and offers the opportunity to change the squares' colors by either \"adding\" color where a square is not filled in, or \"subtracting\" color where a square is already filled in (removing the color from the square).\n",
      "Clicking a particular square on the grid \"toggles\" the color — shifting it from colored to non-colored, or vice versa.\n",
      "\n",
      "Goal: The goal is to make the grid appear exactly symmetrical from left-to-right and top-to-bottom using the fewest number of clicks. (Each click represents one manipulation — either adding or subtracting color from the grid.)\n",
      "Each problem has a known \"lowest\" number of clicks, which represents the best possible answer. However, participants are not given any feedback about whether their answer was the best. Finally, participants must complete the task within the time limit.\n",

      "\n",
      "Goal: Participants are asked to talk about and submit a response to the discussion statement — that is, they need to turn in a written summary of their arguments or answers to the question given to them. (For example, \"Yes, birth control should be made available to anyone for three reasons, Number 1…\" or \"No, we should not make birth control available to everyone. You should need a prescription because …\") If people disagree, the summary needs to resolve and synthesize the pros and cons.\n",
      "Participants have a specific time limit for completing the writeup. They are graded on the quality of their final written summary.\n",
